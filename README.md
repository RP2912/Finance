## Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains the code for a credit card fraud detection project, focusing on analyzing and predicting fraudulent transactions. Due to the size constraints, the dataset is not uploaded here, but you can find the complete code and analysis in the provided Jupyter Notebook file.

### Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry, and early detection is crucial for minimizing losses. This project aims to build a robust machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions using various features of the transaction data.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:**
  - Conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the dataset for modeling.
  - Used RobustScaler to handle the presence of outliers without removing them.

- **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
  - Implemented Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset and improve the model's ability to detect fraud.

- **Modeling:**
  - Built and trained a Random Forest classifier, taking advantage of its robustness and ability to handle large datasets.
  - Tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the model's performance.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC score.
  - Achieved significant improvements in recall and F1-score for the minority class (fraudulent transactions) after applying SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning.

### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook (`fraud_detection.ipynb`) contains:
- Data loading and preprocessing steps
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Application of SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Implementation and training of the Random Forest classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Evaluation of model performance with various metrics
